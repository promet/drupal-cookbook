[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/GBognar/drupal-cookbook.png)](https://travis-ci.org/GBognar/drupal-cookbook)

Description
===========

Installs and configures Drupal; it creates the drupal db user, db password and the database.

Requirements
============

## Platform:

Tested on Debian Wheezy (7.1) and Ubuntu 13.04. As long as the required cookbooks work
(php, php-fpm, apache/nginx, mysql/postgres) it should work just fine on any
other distribution.

## Cookbooks:

Opscode cookbooks (http://github.com/opscode/cookbooks/tree/master)

* php
* apache2
* mysql
* openssl (used to generate the secure random drupal db password)
* firewall
* php-fpm
* nginx
* postgresql
* postfix (optional)
* cron (optional)

# ATTRIBUTES:

* drupal[:webserver] - webserver to use (:default: apache, can be nginx)
* drupal[:dir] - location to copy the drupal files. (default: /var/www/drupal)
* drupal[:db][:type] - drupal database type (default: mysql, can be postgresql)
* drupal[:db][:database] - drupal database (default: drupal)
* drupal[:db][:user] - drupal db user (default: drupal)
* drupal[:db][:host] - durpal db host (default: localhost)
* drupal[:db][:password] - drupal db password (randomly generated if not defined)
* drupal[:db][:site][:admin] - drupal admin name (default: admin)
* drupal[:db][:site][:pass] - drupal admin password (drupaladmin)

* drupal[:version] - version of drupal to download and install (default: 7.22)
* drupal[:src] - where to place the drupal source tarball (default: Chef::Config[:file_cache_path])
* drupal[:drush][:version] - version of drush to download (default: 7.x-5.9)
* drupal[:drush][:checksum] - sha256sum of the drush tarball
* drupal[:drush][:dir] - where to install the drush file. (default: /usr/local/drush)

# USAGE:

Include the drupal recipe to install Drupal on your system; this will enable also the drupal cron:

  include_recipe "drupal"

Further information is present in the metadata.rb file.

# NOTES:

* If the en_US.UTF-8 is not among the locales present on the target OS the
convergence will fail.i
* As a default the recipe installs postfix. If you decide not to install it,
see https://drupal.org/node/1826652 for possible solutions.
* Some ideas and naming convenvions were taken from the drupal-cookbok by RiotGames (https://github.com/RiotGames/drupal-cookbook)
